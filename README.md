# Getting And Cleaning Data - Course Project

## Introduction

This repo contains my course project to [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org) ["Getting And Cleaning Data"](https://class.coursera.org/getdata-034) course that is part of [Data Science](https://www.coursera.org/specialization/jhudatascience/1?utm_medium=listingPage) specialization.

There is only one R script called `run_analysis.R`. It contains all functions and code to do the following:

1. Download data from [source] (https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip) as a zip file to working directory
2. Read data
3. Do some transformations
4. Write output data to a CSV file inside working directory

The `CodeBook.md` explains it more detailed.

The text file `run_analysis.txt` is the result of the R script as mentioned above.
